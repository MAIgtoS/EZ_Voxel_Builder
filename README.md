Final name TBD.

This mod is designed to make creating/removing, and copying/pasting Nodes (Blocks) easy. Simple commands are used to expedite the creation process. Once enabled, the mod works as follows:

- Bring up the command terminal ('/' key by default)
- Type 'b' for Build or 'c' for Copy followed by 3 parameters (ie. /b 10 10 6)
- The parameters are 'Nodes Forward' 'Nodes Right' 'Nodes Up'
  - Note that parameter directions are based on the direction facing, not a specific direction like 'North'
  - The first position starts with the node immediately in front of the player
- Using /b 10 10 6 will build a structure 10 nodes forward by 10 nodes to the right by 6 nodes tall
 - Note that the structure built will be of the node currently being wielded by the player
 - If not wielding anything, the 'structure' built will be of "air", effectively deleting an area of nodes
- Using /c 10 -10 6 will copy 10 nodes forward by 10 nodes to the left by 6 nodes tall
- Once an area has been copied, the player can type '/p' to paste the identical area in a new location and rotation
